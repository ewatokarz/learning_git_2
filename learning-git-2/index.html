        <h1>Viva la Vida</h1>
        <h2>by Coldplay</h2>
        
        <p>I used to rule the world <br> Seas would rise when I gave the word <br> Now in the morning, I sleep alone <br> Sweep the streets I used to own </p>
        <p>I used to roll the dice <br> Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes <br> Listen as the crowd would sing <br> Now the old king is dead, long live the king <br> One minute I held the key <br> Next the walls were closed on me <br> And I discovered that my castles stand <br> Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</p>
